# Frontend-Backend Integration

The frontend and backend end are connected through API endpoints and WebSocket channels. All data is sent and received as JSON.

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints will need a Bearer Token to make API calls. To get a token, call the login or register route get the token. Add that token to "Authorization" header with every HTTP request like so, `"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"`. Tokens are deleted when the user logs out.

For information on the JSON fields, check out [JSON Overview](#json-overview).

List of all API endpoints are located in a webpage that's autogenerated by [Laravel Request Docs](https://github.com/rakutentech/laravel-request-docs):

## WebSocket Channels

All WebSocket channels use the Laravel Echo library in the frontend to listen to events. WebSockets are implemented using the Pub-Sub pattern. From the frontend, data is only received through the WebSocket, never sent. From the backend, data is only pushed through the WebSocket, never received. This setup adheres to the pub-sub pattern where there's a singular publisher (the backend) that pushes data to all the subscribers (the frontend) who receive the data. 

Each client will use one WebSocket connection, which is stored in a global state management system managed by the [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) package.

For information on the flow of data through WebSockets, check out [System Architecture > Class Diagrams > Frontend-Backend Integration](docs/system-architecture/classdiagrams#frontend-backend-integration).

**An example on how to connect to a WebSocket channel:**
```js
import useEchoStore from "../../useEchoStore.js";
import { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const laravelEcho = useEchoStore((state) => state.laravelEcho);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (laravelEcho) {
        laravelEcho.channel("channel-name").listen("EventName", (event) => {
          console.log(event.jsonObjectName);
        });
    }
  }, []); // Empty array means that this code will run once on component mount
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**An example JSON response:**

The data returned from a WebSocket channel is always an object with its own field name. Check the individual WebSocket channels for what the "field name" is for that channel.

```json
{
  "field name": object
}
```

### `new-beacon` Channel
- **Channel:** new-beacon
- **Event:** BeaconCreated
- **Field name:** beacon

Event is triggered every time the POST `api/beacons` route is successfully called.

### `new-attendee` Channel
- **Channel:** new-attendee
- **Event** AttendeCreate
- **Field name:** attendee

## JSON Overview

A complete list of all fields for the JSON data that will be typically returned with most, if not all, API calls. Do not include fields that are marked read-only in your request. Read-only fields are meant to be received only.

The `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are read-only. They are automatically maintained by the Laravel framework.

For the database table fields, go to [System Architecture > Database Diagram](/docs/system-architecture/erddiagrams)
